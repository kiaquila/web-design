# Ember — interactive burn study

A single-page interactive study for the **ks·design lab**: a dark tangled
wireframe figure smolders with golden embers, burns down completely, and
reassembles — scored by a deep meditative tuning-fork tone (136.1 Hz,
synthesized with the Web Audio API, no audio files).

## Source provenance

- Motion reference: Pinterest pin <https://pin.it/163xR16nq> — a hero
  animation by `@skvortsov.design` (shared by NewForm's "Designer of the
  Week"). Only the motion idea is reproduced (smoldering particle figure with
  golden embers, smoke, and flying gold shards on a warm light-gray stage);
  no assets, code, or copy were taken from it.
- Interaction/layout reference: <https://reactive-dots.vercel.app> — a
  centered figure with a minimal control row at the bottom.
- Client decisions (Kristina, 2026-08-19): hover makes the figure burn
  locally and then recover instead of burning away; Play runs the full
  burn-and-reassemble cycle with the tuning-fork strike (a shape-shifting
  rebirth variant was tried and rolled back the same day); controls are
  limited to play/stop and mute; the favicon is the wireframe ball with an
  inverted palette for dark color schemes plus PNG fallbacks for Safari; the
  wordmark is "ks·design" — tracked caps with the brand-gold dot on the
  baseline, hugging the KS with a wide gap before DESIGN (`#e8a038`, shared
  with the ks portfolio) — used in the header only; the footer credit stays plain
  text: "Designed by ks-design · Built with AI workflows", linking to
  <https://ks-design.art>.

## Implementation

- [`website/src/index.html`](./website/src/index.html) — the whole page:
  inline CSS and vanilla JS, canvas 2D rendering, Web Audio synthesis. No
  dependencies, no network requests, system fonts only. The only sibling files
  are the two baked favicon PNGs.
- [`website/scripts/build.mjs`](./website/scripts/build.mjs) — copies those
  three files into `dist/` and refuses to build a page that gained an
  off-origin reference or lost a favicon.
- [`website/worker/index.ts`](./website/worker/index.ts) — the Cloudflare
  Worker that serves `dist/` and attaches the security headers.
- Audio starts only after a user gesture (browser autoplay policy). The page
  follows the same pattern as the reactive-dots reference: a best-effort
  `AudioContext` resume on the first pointer move (works on returning visits
  where the browser already trusts the site), a guaranteed unlock on any
  click/tap/key (with a one-sample silent buffer for iOS), and the mute
  button silences everything.
- The favicon is an inline SVG data URI with a `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  media query inside the SVG (supported by Chrome and Firefox). Safari
  ignores SVG favicons, so [`website/favicon-32.png`](./website/favicon-32.png)
  and [`website/apple-touch-icon.png`](./website/apple-touch-icon.png) carry
  the same ball baked onto the page's warm-gray ground.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables rotation, sparks, and smoke while keeping
  the play cycle functional.

## Stage

The study is published as its own Cloudflare Worker, `ember`, at
[ember.ks-design.workers.dev](https://ember.ks-design.workers.dev) and at the
custom domain [ember.ks-design.art](https://ember.ks-design.art) the portfolio
links. Its dashboard settings live in
[`docs/stage-hosting.md`](../docs/stage-hosting.md); the deploy itself is run
by Cloudflare, not by this repository.

## Checks

- `npm --prefix ember/website run check` — the build plus its tests.
- `npm --prefix ember/website run dev` — build and serve `dist/` on port 4660.
- Verify by hand: hover ignition and recovery, the full Play cycle (burn →
  gone → reassemble → loop), Stop, mute, the footer link, the favicon in light
  and dark browser themes, and a narrow-viewport layout. Sound needs a real
  gesture — a scripted `click()` grants no user activation, and a browser
  profile that has already earned media engagement resumes the context
  immediately, which hides exactly the bug a fresh profile reveals.
- `node scripts/check-repository.mjs` from the repository root.
