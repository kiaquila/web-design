# GitHub repository setup

The template contains guardrail workflows; repository settings still require an
owner with GitHub administration access.

The template-v2 cutover PR is a one-time trust bootstrap: if the default branch
does not yet contain `.web-design/project.json`, Repository Guard uses the
proposed template-v2 checker and emits a warning. After that PR is merged, every
later pull request uses the checker from the trusted default branch. Review the
bootstrap PR independently before merge and never reintroduce a pre-v2 default
branch afterward.

After the first green workflow run:

1. Confirm the repository is private unless its content is intentionally public.
2. Keep `main` as the default branch and enable automatic head-branch deletion.
3. Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests so `Web Design Update` can work.
4. If `kiaquila/web-design` remains private, add `WEB_DESIGN_READ_TOKEN` as an
   Actions secret. Use a fine-grained token or GitHub App installation token
   with read-only Contents access to that repository and no access to customer
   repositories. It is used only by trusted `workflow_dispatch` and
   `workflow_run` jobs, never by a pull-request job. Rotate it independently.
5. Configure the Codex repository environment/application, then request a review
   for the current full PR head SHA.
6. When the repository plan supports it, protect `main` with pull requests,
   required Code Owner review, conversation resolution, no force pushes, no
   branch deletion, stale approval dismissal, and the actual check names from
   `.web-design/project.json`. Do not register a required check before it has
   run. `.github/CODEOWNERS` is still a managed file in this release, and is
   being handed over to projects in the next one: the updater that performs the
   handover ships here, but a consumer only runs it *after* this release is
   installed, so revoking the file here would have the previous updater delete
   it on the way in. Until the handover lands, do not edit it — an edit is
   managed-file drift, and the previous updater refuses an update while it
   stands. Enable the rest of the ruleset now and leave required Code Owner
   review until the file names an owner with rights in this repository; the
   paths it lists are not yours to choose in either release, because the
   baseline tests check that every managed path is covered by some owner and
   name the missing one when it is not.
   `baseline-source-verification` is published against the PR head by a trusted
   default-branch `workflow_run`; require that exact check name after its first
   successful run.
7. Protect the privileged manual workflow with an environment, not only with
   its `if` condition. A manual run selects a ref, and GitHub loads that ref's
   copy of the workflow file, so a branch can delete the condition it disagrees
   with before asking for the write token. The repository guard can only check
   the workflows a pull request proposes; it cannot police a direct branch push.
   The job already declares `environment: web-design-update`, so GitHub creates
   that environment on its first run. Creating it is not the control — open it
   and restrict its deployment branches to the default branch, so GitHub, not
   the workflow file, decides whether the job may run and whether its secrets
   are readable. Scope `WEB_DESIGN_READ_TOKEN` to that environment rather than
   to the repository. Until the branch rule is applied, treat push access to
   this repository as equivalent to write access through this workflow, and
   record that rather than claiming the condition enforces it.
   The Codex Review dispatch job needs the same treatment: it declares
   `environment: codex-review-dispatch` and holds `checks: write`, so restrict
   that environment's deployment branches to the default branch too. A branch
   copy of the workflow could otherwise mint a passing required check.
   Project-owned deployment workflows use the exact environment name
   `production`. Create that environment and restrict its deployment branches
   to the default branch as well, even while the repository uses `no-deploy`,
   so a branch cannot introduce a privileged manual workflow before the owner
   configures the control. The repository guard accepts only
   `web-design-update`, `codex-review-dispatch`, and `production` on a
   write-capable manual job, matched exactly, because an environment nobody has
   restricted is created on first use with no rules on it — a renamed one would
   read as gated here and be protected by nothing. A privileged manual workflow
   under another name is a reviewed change to the managed guard and this list
   together.
8. Enable available dependency alerts, automated fixes, secret scanning, and
   push protection.
9. Keep deployment secrets in the `production` environment-scoped store and
   require any desired human approval there. Its deployment branch restriction
   is the default branch rule from step 7.

Some private-repository plans do not expose branch protection or rulesets and
may return `403` from their APIs. Record the missing control instead of claiming
it is active. Do not make a private repository public to unlock a protection
feature.

When enforced protection is unavailable, the repository owner must apply the
completion contract manually before every merge: record the exact full head SHA;
confirm that every contractual check is successful on that same head; confirm
that every P0-P2 review finding is resolved; then observe a 120-second quiet
period and fetch the PR again. Immediately before merging, recheck that the head
SHA is unchanged, the same checks are still green, and no unresolved P0-P2
thread or newer blocking review has appeared. This documented procedure is a
mandatory fallback, not a claim that the branch is technically protected.

For organization-owned repositories, prefer an organization ruleset with a
required workflow or a GitHub App check for the strongest immutable guard. In a
user-owned repository, the default-branch `workflow_run` plus required Code
Owner review protects the shared workflow and baseline paths from collaborator
changes, but the repository owner remains an administrative trust root.
